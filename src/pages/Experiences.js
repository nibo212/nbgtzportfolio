        <h2>CESI</h2>
        <p>After obtaining a science baccalaureate in German, I joined the preparatory cycle for computer science at CESI. I then continued my studies by choosing the apprenticeship path for the computer engineering cycle. What I prefer at CESI is the project-based pedagogy because it has allowed me to develop both my practical and interpersonal skills.</p>

        <p>
Infosat represents my first professional experience in the world of computer science. It has been very beneficial for me as I was able to significantly improve my technical skills, notably by working on a project with significant architecture and using different technologies.</p>

        <p>Apside is my current apprenticeship company. It has allowed me to work on projects as interesting as they are varied, such as Serious Game or Checklist. This is where I developed my programming, deployment, and project management skills the most. I was also able to do an internal internship at Apside Montreal, which also allowed me to discover the world of work abroad.</p>
